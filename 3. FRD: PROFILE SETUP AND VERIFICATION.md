# Feature Requirements Document (FRD)

## Module: Profiles, Identity & Verification

## Product: Decentralized Healthcare Operating System (D-HOS)

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This FRD defines the requirements for **user (patient), professional, and institutional profile creation**, including **identity verification, credential validation, and trust signaling**.

This module underpins:
- Patient–professional matching accuracy
- Marketplace trust
- Regulatory compliance
- Ratings, reputation, and accountability

The system must balance **low-friction onboarding** with **high-trust verification**, using progressive disclosure and tiered verification.

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Trust is contextual** – verification depth depends on the action (e.g., browsing vs prescribing).
2. **The platform verifies, not practices medicine** – professionals retain legal responsibility.
3. **Progressive verification** – users can join quickly but unlock privileges as they verify.
4. **Auditability without surveillance** – actions are traceable; data access is minimal.
5. **Jurisdiction-aware** – verification logic adapts to country and regulator.
