## 6. Product Scope

### 6.0 Product vs. Infrastructure: The Core Distinction (FRD 1–4)

FRD 1–4 are product-grade platforms or foundational capabilities—not “features.” The distinction drives strategy: **product** (standalone value, own adoption) vs. **infrastructure** (enables products, no standalone differentiation). Full description of each is in the FRD itself.

| FRD | Classification | Nature (summary) |
|-----|----------------|------------------|
| **FRD 1: Physician Virtual Suite** | **Product** | Product by nature; platform core by strategy. A multi-tenant SaaS(Software as a Service); can onboard physicians and monetize independently. |
| **FRD 2: Telemedicine Engine** | **Infrastructure** | Foundational capability. Value comes from being embedded in the Virtual Suite and governed by clinical, consent, and compliance layers. |
| **FRD 3: Healthcare Marketplace** | **Product** | Full product with network effects and two-sided dynamics; benefits from shared trust, identity, and compliance. |
| **FRD 4: Intelligent Matching Engine** | **Product** | Productizable engine and differentiator; strategically constrained to decision-support, embedded and paired with accountable clinicians. |

### 6.0a FRD 5–9: Platform Layers

FRD 5–9 are **platform layers**: they extend or underpin the core products (FRD 1–4) rather than standing as independent products. FRD 5 is product-adjacent (revenue/extension); FRD 6–9 are cross-cutting infrastructure.

| FRD | Classification | Nature (summary) |
|-----|----------------|------------------|
| **FRD 5: Care Plan Authoring & Subscription** | **Product / Extension** | Product-grade; own adoption and revenue (revenue share). Extends the Virtual Suite and matching. |
| **FRD 6: Ratings, Reputation & Trust** | **Trust Layer** | Cross-cutting infrastructure; enables trust across marketplace and suite. |
| **FRD 7: Hybrid Care Bridge** | **Integration Layer** | Connects virtual platform to physical care (labs, pharmacies, hospitals). |
| **FRD 8: AI Emergency Guidance & Clinical Safety** | **Safety Layer** | Clinical safety infrastructure; bundled, non-monetized initially. |
| **FRD 9: Security, Privacy & Governance** | **Governance Layer** | Foundational; applies to all modules (RBAC, consent, audit). |

Can onboard physicians/hospitals independently, generate revenue without telemedicine volume, and exist without patients discovering the broader marketplace.

**Objective**  
Enable healthcare professionals to operate fully customizable, autonomous virtual clinics. Clinics, hospitals and other healthcare related institutions will also be able to create a customizable virtual suite, so employed professionals can consult and reach out to a wider customer base.

**Users**  
Physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists (role-scoped), health institutions.

- Region-aware protocols (where feasible)
- Continuous clinical review & updating of guidance


### FRD 9: Security, Privacy & Governance — *Governance Layer*

**Classification**  
Governance layer (infrastructure). Foundational; applies to all modules. RBAC, consent, validation, audit. Cross-cutting security, privacy, and compliance.

## MVP Scope: What We Build First

Take things one after the other. Do not burden the team with Phase 2 or Phase 3 scope until MVP is live and meeting success criteria. This section defines the **minimum** we ship first.

### MVP: In Scope (Only This)

| # | Capability | FRD | MVP scope (limit to this) |
|---|------------|-----|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Governance baseline** | FRD 9 | RBAC, per-consultation consent capture, immutable audit log, data residency. No extra governance features. |
| 2 | **Profiles & verification** | Profile FRD | Patient: signup, basic profile, consent. Professional: signup, profile, credential upload, identity + license verification to “License Verified” so they can see patients. No institution profiles. |
| 3 | **Physician Virtual Suite (basic)** | FRD 1 | One virtual clinic per professional. Branding (name, services, pricing), scheduling/availability, NDPC/FHIR documentation, manual e-prescriptions. No multi-practitioner or institutional suite. |
| 4 | **Telemedicine Engine** | FRD 2 | Secure video/audio (WebRTC), per-encounter consent, session metadata. Low-bandwidth fallback. No content recording; no async chat/voice notes if it keeps MVP simpler (add in Phase 2 if needed). |
| 5 | **Payments** | — | Collect and disburse for consultations only. No care-plan subscriptions, no marketplace fees. |
| 6 | **Ratings (consultation-level only)** | FRD 6 | Post-consultation star rating + short comment. No weighted reputation score, fraud/abuse considerations, dispute flow considerations |


### MVP: Out of Scope (Do Not Build Yet)

- **FRD 3: Healthcare Marketplace** — No listings, search, sponsored results, or discovery. In MVP, patients reach physicians via direct link or a simple directory only.
- **FRD 4: Intelligent Matching Engine** — No symptom-based triage or match recommendations. Patients choose a professional themselves.
- **FRD 5: Care Plan Authoring & Subscription** — No care plans in MVP.
- **FRD 7: Hybrid Care Bridge** — No lab orders, pharmacy fulfillment, or hospital referrals.
- **FRD 8: AI Emergency Guidance** — Not in MVP; add after clinical validation and approval.
- **Phase 2:** Peer-to-peer collaboration, marketplace listings, referrals and bridge integrations.
- **Phase 3:** Locum tenens, institutional dashboards, advanced reputation scoring.
- **Institutions:** No institution/hospital profiles or multi-practitioner suites in MVP.

### Suggested Build Order (One After the Other)

1. **Governance baseline** (FRD 9 minimal) — consent, audit, RBAC, data residency.  
2. **Profiles & verification** — patients and professionals can onboard and get verified.  
3. **Virtual Suite (basic)** (FRD 1) — professionals can set up one clinic, set availability, and document.  
4. **Telemedicine Engine** (FRD 2) — secure video/audio consultations with consent.  
5. **Payments** — pay for and get paid for consultations.  
6. **Ratings** — post-consult rating and comment only.

Do not add the next item until the current one is shippable and stable. Revisit this list when MVP success criteria are met before committing to Phase 2.
