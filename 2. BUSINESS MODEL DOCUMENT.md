# Business Model Document (BMD)
## Product: HealthNet Operating System (HOS)


## 1. Executive Overview

HealthNet Operating System (HOS) is a **physician-first healthcare operating system** that combines virtual practice infrastructure, intelligent patient–professional matching, longitudinal care plans, workforce mobility (locum tenens), peer-to-peer collaboration, and a regulated healthcare marketplace.

Telemedicine is the **entry wedge**, not the business.

The long-term value of HOS lies in owning the **coordination layer of healthcare delivery**—how patients, professionals, and institutions discover, trust, pay, collaborate, and deliver care across physical and virtual boundaries.

HOS is infrastructure, not a clinic.
