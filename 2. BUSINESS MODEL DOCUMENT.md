# Business Model Document (BMD)
## Product: HealthNet Operating System (HOS)


## 1. Executive Overview

HealthNet Operating System (HOS) is a **physician-first healthcare operating system** that combines virtual practice infrastructure, intelligent patient–professional matching, longitudinal care plans, workforce mobility (locum tenens), peer-to-peer collaboration, and a regulated healthcare marketplace.

Telemedicine is the **entry wedge**, not the business.

The long-term value of HOS lies in owning the **coordination layer of healthcare delivery**—how patients, professionals, and institutions discover, trust, pay, collaborate, and deliver care across physical and virtual boundaries.

HOS is infrastructure, not a clinic.

## 2. MVP vs. Later Phases: What We’re Looking At First

**Principle:** Do not burden the team with Phase 2 or Phase 3 until MVP is live and meeting success criteria. Know what is **in** and **out** of scope before the next phase.

### 2.1 MVP: In Scope (Only This)

| # | Capability | Revenue in MVP |
|---|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Governance baseline (RBAC, consent, audit, data residency) | — (foundation) |
| 2 | Profiles & verification (patients + professionals; no institutions) | — (foundation) |
| 3 | Physician Virtual Suite (basic): one clinic per professional, branding, scheduling, docs, e‑prescriptions | Monthly SaaS (basic tier) |
| 4 | Telemedicine Engine: video/audio, consent, low‑bandwidth | — (embedded in suite) |
| 5 | Payments | Platform fee per consultation (e.g. 5–10%) |
| 6 | Ratings | Consultation-level only (stars + comment); no reputation engine or dispute flow |

**MVP revenue:** Consultation fees + basic Virtual Suite SaaS. No care-plan revenue share, no marketplace fees, no locum, no bridge fees.

**MVP customers:** Patients and physicians (and allied professionals). No institutions, no labs/pharmacies as platform customers.

**MVP success criteria (from PRD):** 50–100 onboarded physicians; ≥80% successful consult completion; &lt;5% session failure due to connectivity; physician NPS &gt;40.

### 2.2 MVP: Out of Scope (Do Not Build Yet)

- **Marketplace (FRD 3)** — No listings, search, sponsored results. Patients reach physicians via direct link or simple directory only.
- **Intelligent Matching (FRD 4)** — No symptom-based triage or match recommendations.
- **Care plans (FRD 5)** — No care-plan authoring or subscription revenue.
- **Hybrid Bridge (FRD 7)** — No lab orders, pharmacy fulfillment, hospital referrals.
- **AI Emergency Guidance (FRD 8)** — Not in MVP.
- **Institutions** — No institution/hospital profiles or multi-practitioner suites.
- **Phase 2:** Peer-to-peer collaboration, marketplace listings, referrals and bridge integrations.
- **Phase 3:** Locum tenens, institutional dashboards, advanced reputation scoring.

Revisit this when MVP success criteria are met before committing to Phase 2.

## 13. Long-Term Vision

HOS becomes the default operating layer for independent healthcare delivery and coordination across borders and systems.

The end-state is a **healthcare coordination utility**, not an app.

---

## Closing Statement

HOS monetizes **coordination, trust, and continuity**—not medical decisions—aligning incentives with better outcomes, physician well-being, and scalable access.
