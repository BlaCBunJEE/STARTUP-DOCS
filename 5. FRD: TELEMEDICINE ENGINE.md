# Feature Requirements Document (FRD 2): Telemedicine Engine (MVP)

**Product:** HealthNet Operating System (HOS)  
**FRD Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  

**Classification:** *Infrastructure*  
Infrastructure; foundational capability, not a standalone product. Standalone it is a commodity (e.g. Zoom-for-health), easily replicated, low differentiation. Value comes from being embedded inside the Virtual Suite and governed by clinical, consent, and compliance layers. See PRD §6.0 for product vs infrastructure taxonomy.
