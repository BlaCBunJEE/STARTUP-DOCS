# Feature Requirements Document (FRD 4): Intelligent Patient–Professional Matching Engine

**Product:** HealthNet Operating System (HOS)  
**FRD Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  

## Objective
Provide decision-support recommendations that connect patients to the most clinically and contextually appropriate professionals based on symptoms, urgency, preferences, and constraints—never making autonomous diagnoses.

## Users
- Patients (symptom input)  
- Professionals & institutions (profile visibility & outcome data)

## Functional Requirements
### Input & Processing
- Free-text symptom entry + optional structured fields (age, gender, duration, severity).
- Clinical concept extraction: Map to ICD-10 / SNOMED CT codes using validated NLP models.
- Urgency classification: Routine / Urgent / Emergency (with clear red-flag triggers).

### Matching Logic
- Core factors: Specialty alignment, sub-specialty match, outcome history (anonymized aggregate success rates), current availability, time zone compatibility, licensing validity & geo-fencing.
- Patient preferences: Language, gender, consultation style (e.g., empathetic, direct), virtual vs hybrid.
- Ranking: Weighted score with transparent breakdown (e.g., “80% specialty fit, 15% availability, 5% patient rating”).
- Output: 3–5 ranked recommendations + “See more” option; explain why each match was selected.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: < 3 seconds for recommendations.
- Accuracy target: ≥85% user satisfaction with top-3 matches (post-consult feedback).

## Regulatory & Compliance
- MDCN/NDPC: Decision-support only; no diagnosis claim.
- Transparency: Show match factors; log all recommendations for audit.

## Constraints & Safety
- No forced assignment—patient chooses.
- Emergency escalation: If emergency detected → immediate guidance (link to FRD 8) + prompt to seek in-person care.
- Bias mitigation: Regular audits of matching outcomes by demographic.

## Success Criteria
- ≥75% of patients book from recommended list.
- <2% of matches flagged as inappropriate in feedback.
