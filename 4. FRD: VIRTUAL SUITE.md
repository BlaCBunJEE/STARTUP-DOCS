# Feature Requirements Document (FRD 1): Physician & Institutional Virtual Suite

**Product:** HealthNet Operating System (HOS)  
**FRD Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** Draft  

## Objective
Enable licensed healthcare professionals and institutions (clinics, hospitals, etc.) to operate fully customizable, autonomous virtual clinics/suites. This allows physicians (solo or group) and employed professionals within institutions to consult, reach wider patient bases, and deliver location-independent care while maintaining full clinical responsibility.

## Users
- Physicians (GPs, specialists, diaspora)
- Nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists (role-scoped)
- Healthcare institutions (hospitals, clinics) creating suites for staff

## Functional Requirements
### Common Features
- Customizable branding: Clinic/hospital name, logo, tagline, color scheme, welcome message, services list, pricing tiers.
- Role-based access control (RBAC): Admin (institution/owner), Practitioner (consulting), Support staff (scheduling/view-only).
- Scheduling: Calendar sync (Google/Outlook/iCal), virtual slot booking, availability zones, recurring/blocked times, patient reminders via SMS/email/push.
- Documentation: NDPC- and FHIR-compliant patient records; templates for notes, history, follow-up.
- Manual e-prescriptions: Digitally signed (non-automated), printable PDF, medication database lookup, dosage/contraindication warnings.
- Practice analytics: Dashboard for patients seen, revenue (consults/care plans), no-show rates, outcomes (aggregated), export (CSV/PDF).

### Professional-Specific
- Solo/group practice setup: Invite collaborators, assign roles/permissions.
- Service catalog: Define consult types (video/audio/async), durations, prices.

### Institution-Specific
- Multi-practitioner support: Link verified staff profiles, assign to institutional suite.
- Branding inheritance: Staff suites inherit institution branding with overrides.
- Oversight tools: Admin view of all consultations, compliance audit logs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Offline draft support: Save notes/prescriptions locally, sync on reconnect.
- Full audit trail: Immutable logs of all actions (create/edit/view).
- Low-bandwidth optimization: Progressive loading, text-first fallback.
- Performance: Load <3s, consult setup <10s.

## Regulatory & Compliance
- MDCN: Practitioner must hold valid license; signed clinical responsibility agreement before activation.
- NDPC: Data residency in Nigeria for local users; role-based access; consent logging.
- FHIR: Use standard resources (Patient, Encounter, Observation, MedicationRequest).

## Constraints & Safety
- Platform is infrastructure only; physicians/institutions retain liability.
- No auto-diagnosis or auto-prescribing.
- Mandatory disclaimer display.

## Success Criteria
- 90% of suites setup completed in <10 min.
- ≥95% audit trail completeness in tests.
- Positive feedback on customization (NPS >45).
